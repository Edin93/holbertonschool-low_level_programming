# Single linked list:
* It's a linear data structure.
* Its elements aren't stored in contiguous memory locations.
* Each elements in the linked list is called a node.
* Each node has the Data and the pointer that contains the address to the next node.

# Disandantages:
* accessing a certain node isn't that fast unlike arrays.

# Advantages:
* Insertion and deletion of data is faster unlike arrays.
* Dynamic data growth.
