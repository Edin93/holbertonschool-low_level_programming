# 0x1E. C - Search Algorithms

## Learning Objectives
* What is a search algorithm
* What is a linear search
* What is a binary search
* What is the best search algorithm to use depending on wer needs

## Requirements
* Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
* All wer files will be compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
* Our programs and functions will be compiled with gcc 4.8.4 using the flags -Wall -Werror -Wextra and -pedantic
* All wer files should end with a new line
* A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
* wer code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
* we are not allowed to use global variables
* No more than 5 functions per file
* we are only allowed to use the printf function of the standard library. Any call to another function like strdup, malloc, … is forbidden.
* In the following examples, the main.c files are shown as examples. we can use them to test our functions, but you don’t have to push them to your repo (if you do we won’t take them into account). We will use our own main.c files at compilation. Our main.c files might be different from the one shown in the examples
* The prototypes of all wer functions should be included in our header file called search_algos.h
* All wer header files should be include guarded
